<p>Experience Setting Up GitHub</p>

<p>My experience of setting up GitHub and publishing to pages was very simple and straightforward. 
  I managed to set everything up myself with the use of the slides provided showing me what to do step by step. 
  I hope this process remains this simple as I continue and does not confuse me as I did have challenges with using and understanding GitHub in my second year. </p>

<p>Readings</p>

<p>The Library of Babel, by Jorge Luis Borges (1941)</p>

<p>In the library of Babel, Borges touches on the topic of a library existing of unlimited information and resources and gives an example of endless characters in books.
  The Library of Babel is a representation of arbitrary, immense complexity and inexhaustible knowledge. 
  There is close similarity to what we experience with the internet today as there are multiple platforms that share a large amount of data and provide multiple resources such that
   not all the information out there is reliable or accurate.
  Critical thinking is required to read through and choose specific content that makes the most sense to you and content or information that you may find the most meaning in.
   The reality is that you will not read through every source as they are unlimited but will have to navigate through finding the most accurate information. </p>

<p>The History of the Web</p>

<p>Interesting things that I found out about the web is that it is a never ending cycle and that the web will never stop development and growing.
  A tool can rise very quickly but also fall as fast due to new innovations coming in. There is always going to be better therefore developers should always have room for improvement and adaptability. 
  Technology has grown and developed rapidly from way back and will continue to do so especially because the world is heading towards that direction.
   It is important to think ahead and consider future trends that may be vital for improving performance and security. </p>
